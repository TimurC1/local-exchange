Q&A
---

Q: *Aren't file transfers a solved problem?*  
A: Not entirely. This tool was written years ago for fast file transfers on Lan-Parties (hence the name), where we had a mix of Windows 98 and Windows XP PCs, and copying files was **not** solved back then.

Q: *Ok, but why would anyone use this **today**, we have {$cloudprovider, AirDrop, ...}?*  
A: LanXchange is much faster than the cloud (no slow upload involved) and, unlike AirDrop does support virtually all PC OSes + Android. (anything that can run a JVM)

Q: *But why Java?*  
A: Historical reasons, I was in school when I started this and only knew Java. Plus, years later it made porting LanXchange to Android much easier.

Q: *Automatic updates?*  
A: Auto updates are recommended because updates frequently break compatibility with older versions. You can disable them, but there should be no need: On every launch, LanXchange *checks* for updates (by reading [this file](http://updates.lanxchange.com/v)), but **never** downloads or installs anything automatically. Also, I spent quite some time hardening the updater against a wide range of potential attacks. The [code/javadoc](https://github.com/tfg13/LanXchange/blob/master/modules/cli/src/main/java/de/tobifleig/lxc/plaf/pc/LXCUpdater.java) contains more details. If you think I missed something, please send a mail to *mail Ã¤t lanxchange.com*!
